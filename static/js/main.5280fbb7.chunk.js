One way to help prevent this problem is to use the 20-20-20 rule.

It is a lightweight, console only app that aims to be as unintrusive as possible while still ensuring you take a break to help your eyes."))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(c,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))}],[[4,1,2]]]);
